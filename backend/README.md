# COMP9900 Project Backend

Our backend is implemented on [Railway](https://railway.app) using a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) app server and a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) DB. 

## ‚ú® Features

- Python
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- Postgres

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to use
### Environment Set Up
- (Optional) create a Python3 virtual environment in your desired backend location `virtualenv path/to/directory'
- Clone repo into the environment folder
- Sign up to [Railway](https://railway.app) using your github 
- Install the [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli) on your OS
- Link the Project - you can find this link on the project page in Railway under 'Set up your project locally'
    - Use `railway link <project-link>` in your command line to link it 
- Install Python requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run Flask Server Locally 
- first make sure to run `export FLASK_APP=main.py` in your terminal
- Make sure you are in the  backend folder not the project folder
- To run the Flask server locally but still access the railway DB you need to use the command: `railway run flask run`

### Deploy to Railway
- Change directory to project source
- Use `railway up` to deploy it
    - !!! Make sure to remove the deployment on railway after you are done to save credits !!! 
        - Click on the COMP9900 deployment in Railway 
        - Under the Deployments sub-heading, click the 3-dots symbol next to the deployed app 
        - Click 'Remove Deployment' 
        
### DB Migrations 
- This is used for when you update the datamodel and want to push that to Postgres 
- Simply run the commands:
    - `railway run flask db migrate`
    - `railway run flask db upgrade`
