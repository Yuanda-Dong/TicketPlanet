# Backend
`cd backend`

Our backend is implemented on [Railway](https://railway.app) using a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) app server supported by [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) on a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) DB. 

You can find an existing deployed backend here (https://comp9900-production.up.railway.app/docs)

## ‚ú® Features

- Python
- FastAPI
